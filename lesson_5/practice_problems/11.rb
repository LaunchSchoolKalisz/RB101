Practice Problem 11
Given the following data structure use a combination of methods, including either the select or reject method, to return 
a new array identical in structure to the original but containing only the integers that are multiples of 3.
=end

arr = [[2], [3, 5, 7], [9], [11, 13, 15]]

arr.map do |subarray|
  mult_of_three = subarray.select { |num| num % 3 == 0 }
  p mult_of_three
end
p arr

=begin
LS Solution

arr.map do |element|
  element.select do |num|
    num % 3 == 0
  end
end
# => [[], [3], [9], [15]]

We know that we want to return a new array, so map is a good choice to call on the original array. Technically you could 
use either select or reject for the nested arrays as both would work, however choosing to use select makes the code a 
bit more readable. This is what the same solution would look like with reject:

arr.map do |element|
  element.reject do |num|
    num % 3 != 0
  end
end
# => [[], [3], [9], [15]]

Since the method rejects elements based on the truthiness of the evaluated condition, combining reject with the != 
operator seems somewhat like a double negative and is more difficult to parse than select combined with ==.
