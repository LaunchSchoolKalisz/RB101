Word to Digit
Write a method that takes a sentence string as input, and returns the same string with any sequence of the 
words 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine' converted to a string of 
digits.

Example:

word_to_digit('Please call me at five five five one two three four. Thanks.') == 
  'Please call me at 5 5 5 1 2 3 4. Thanks.'

# Problem
- Create a method which takes a sentence string as input
- Returns the same string with any numbers converted to digits

Input: String
Output: String

# Data
String
Array

# Algo
- Initiate a constant hash with integer words matched with their respective digit
- Create a method which takes one parameter(string)
- Split the string into an array of words
- Clean the words so they don't have punctuation
- Iterate through the arry
  - If the constant hash includes a key of the word being iterated, convert the word into the value of the hash
  - Change in place
- Join the array back into a sentence string

DIGIT_WORDS = {'one': '1', 'two': '2', 'three': '3', 'four': '4', 'five': '5', 'six': '6', 'seven': '7', 
              'eight': '8', 'nine': '9'}

def word_to_digit(sentence)
  sentence = sentence.split(/( )|(\.)|(,)|(:)|(;)|(\/)(!)/).map do |word|
    if DIGIT_WORDS.has_key?(word.downcase.to_sym)
      DIGIT_WORDS[word.downcase.to_sym]
    else
      word
    end
  end
  sentence.join
end

p word_to_digit('Please call me at five five five one two three four. Thanks.') == 'Please call me at 5 5 5 1 2 3 4. Thanks.'

=begin

DIGIT_HASH = {
  'zero' => '0', 'one' => '1', 'two' => '2', 'three' => '3', 'four' => '4',
  'five' => '5', 'six' => '6', 'seven' => '7', 'eight' => '8', 'nine' => '9'
}.freeze

def word_to_digit(words)
  DIGIT_HASH.keys.each do |word|
    words.gsub!(/\b#{word}\b/, DIGIT_HASH[word])
  end
  words
end

Discussion
This one is a bit tricky. First, we define a hash that serves as a dictionary for converting words to digits. 
It's useful to store values we want to convert in one place, and a hash works nicely for this. If we replace 
the word 'eight' in a sentence, we can use DIGIT_HASH to find the value that should replace it.

Within our word_to_digit method, we must convert all the words from zero to nine to digits. To do that, we 
iterate through all the number words we want to replace, and replace all instances of the word with the 
corresponding digit.

We use the gsub! method to replace all instances of each number word. Here, we use a regex to look for a word 
in the string passed in and replace it with the corresponding digit. The word to look for is interpolated into 
the regex, /\b#{word}\b/. We use \b to limit the operation to complete words, not substrings. For instance, if 
the phrase/sentence passed into the method has the word "freight" in it, we won't replace it. If we don't 
use \b, we would convert "freight" to "fr8".

Further Exploration
There are many ways to solve this problem and different varieties of it. Suppose, for instance, that we also 
want to replace uppercase and capitalized words.

Can you change your solution so that the spaces between consecutive numbers are removed? Suppose the string 
already contains two or more space separated numbers (not words); can you leave those spaces alone, while 
removing any spaces between numbers that you create?

What about dealing with phone numbers? Is there any easy way to format the result to account for phone numbers? 
For our purposes, assume that any 10 digit number is a phone number, and that the proper format should be 
"(123) 456-7890".
